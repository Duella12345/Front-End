# Front-End
## Project 1 - Easter Egg Hunt Platformer
-	This project was part of the Easter Egg Hunt at BT and was created using pure JavaScript as an in-browser game
-	The main requirements for this project were a quick turn around and configurable levels using txt files so clues could be indicated using the platform shapes to indicate a URL to go to for the next clue / puzzle with distractors such as glasses to see additional platforms and text overlay for win message
-	The project was created iteratively over a two-month period considering additional requirements, bug fixes and changes.
